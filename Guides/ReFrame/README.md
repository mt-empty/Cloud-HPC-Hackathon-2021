# ReFrame

During this workshop we will be using the [ReFrame toolkit](https://github.com/eth-cscs/reframe) to manage code execution, validation and performance logging.

ReFrame is especially useful within this context as it can take a lot of the complexity out of using the HPC recources.
We will tell ReFrame which applications we want to run, and how to run them, and it will generate the appropriate `Slurm` submission scripts, and submit the jobs to the correct queue.
