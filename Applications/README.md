# Applications

Broadly speaking we have broken down our applications into two catagories, `Mini-Apps` and `Full Applications`.
Generally speaking mini-apps will have been ported to multiple different compilers and architectures to evaluate the robustness of the code and methods.
As such, we expect them to be easier to port and run.

Full applications on the other hand are likely to be a bit more complex, and may be new to the Arm HPC ecosystem.
As they tend to be larger, and more complex, they are also likely to be harder to fix, should issues exist.
